**Brandon, gamer that works from home**

Brandon, age 24 works a sales position for a payroll company. He used to work in the office but when the pandemic happened he had to work from home. In his spare time he loves to play video games. Brandon would rather play video games and talk with his friends on discord then make endless cold call after cold call for work. Brandon has been able to be productive at work while still playing a lot of video games daily.

He found himself getting very bored of all the video games that he was playing. He wishes there was an easy way for him and his discord friends to play quick simple games that are fun to pass the time. He is looking for games with low learning curves so his friend will be more tempted to play with him. Brandon and his friends already all use discord to connect so it would be very convenient if there was a way to play games through discord. This would allow him an easy outlet to pass the time when he gets bored.
