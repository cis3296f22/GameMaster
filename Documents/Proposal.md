**Project Abstract**

This document proposes a discord bot that allows users to play Tic-Tac-Toe with other discord users. The user can initiate a game with another user that is also part of the same server. The game will be played inside of a discord server. Games can be paused and played at a later time. The game will be Tic-Tac-Toe. Since users are remote this is a great way for them to connect over a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Conceptual Design**

The initial design concept is to have a discord bot created and added to a server. Have users in that server become authorized with the bot and communicate to each other through the bot. This will then be modified to having the bot send game information back and forth between the users. 
This project will use JavaScript programming language, the Discord API, Nodemon to run the project, and OAuth2 to authorize the users with the discord bot. 

**Proof of Concept**
https://github.com/jay-newman/newBot Here is a link to a discord bot with reply commands to send back images and gifs. In this project you will find a readme file that explains how to set up and run the discord bot. This software was run on Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon. Version 5.2.7 using Javascript/node version 18.9.0.

**Background**

The initial design will use emojis allowing the discord bot to print the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This project aims to have a cleaner looking Tic-Tac-Toe board. Other ways will be explored into which this is possible and would allow the users to customize the game board and symbols used. In this project there will be the ability to change some rules of the common game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This can be done through the bot which will use different logic for the different game styles. This is the initial approach but expanding beyond to different games is another goal that will allow users to play other games besides just Tic-Tac-Toe. This result is intended to be a fun game playing discord bot that will allow users to play games with friends with a customizable experience.

**Required Resources**
There are many resources available to develop a discord bot using javascript. There are written tutorials and videos that will be used in order to get a bot up and running. Software used will be IntelliJ IDEA. Any modern computer/phone with discord app will work with discord so hardware resources are not limited in any way.
